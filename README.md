# TravelersPy

A website with curated travel destinations from across the world that allows users to organize and prioritize their own travel goals and wants.

To-do list:
- Add destination suggestions based on tags/current favorites/initial sign-up preferences
- Make loading of all images wait until they're all ready, then fade them in
- Add tag categories and give every tag a category
- Transition to MaterializeCSS
- Add auto-complete and tag-like look to search
- Make search more filter-y (so I can type West Africa Churches and find churches in West Africa)
