A website with curated travel destinations from across the world that allows users to organize and prioritize their own travel goals and wants.

To-do list:
- Add continent to country table in DB, then incorporate that into search
- Add destination suggestions based on tags/current favorites/initial sign-up preferences
- Make loading of all images wait until they're all ready, then fade them in
- Transition to MaterializeCSS
