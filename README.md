# TravelersPy

A website with curated travel destinations from across the world that allows users to organize and prioritize their own travel goals and wants.

First written in C#, this is now an attempt to move the existing app over into Python with Flask.

To-do list:
- Add tags to destinations and then search
    - Eg: UNESCO, nature, ancient civilizations, mountain, religious
- Add Search capability based on both name, country name, etc. as well as tags
- Improve account page (allow profile pictures, "About Me" section)
- Add pictures to Country pages based on all Destinations within that country
    - Add associated captions to pictures to show here (or just caption with DestName)
