# TravelersPy

A website with curated travel destinations from across the world that allows users to organize and prioritize their own travel goals and wants.

TO-DO:

Short term:
- Add tag categories and give every tag a category
- Convert Search to GET request so that I can redirect from other pages with search (search from clicking on a tag)
- Clean up Search
- Add images to Cloudinary
- Rework styles.less to make it much more efficient and compact
- Update UpdateTime on change on picture/tags/etc. Not just dests table
- Rewatch CSS Grid videos and make the Search page responsive

Long term:
- Add "Trips" so users can make and name a Trip and add destinations they want to go on that trip to it
- Add destination suggestions based on tags/current favorites/initial sign-up preferences
- Make more interactive map where you can click on countries and it zooms into them
